It will serve as a sanity check, and it will establish a baseline \\nthat we will have to beat in order to demonstrate the \\nusefulness of more advanced machine learning models. \\nSuch common-sense baselines can be very useful when approaching a new problem \\nfor  which there is no known solution (yet). A classic example is that of\\nunbalanced classification tasks, where some classes can be much more \\n# common than others. If your dataset contains 90% of instances of class A and 10% of instances of class B, then a common sense approach to \\n# the classification task would be to always predict \"A\" when presented with a new sample. Such a classifier would be 90% accurate overall, \\n# and any learning-based approach should therefore beat this 90% score in order to demonstrate usefulness. Sometimes such elementary \\n# baseline can prove surprisingly hard to beat.\\n# \\n# In our case, the temperature timeseries can safely be assumed to be continuous\\n(the temperatures tomorrow are likely to be close to the \\n# temperatures today) as well as periodical with a daily period. \\nThus a common sense approach would be to always predict that the temperature \\n# 24 hours from now will be equal to the temperature right now.\\nLet\\'s evaluate this approach, using the Mean Absolute Error metric (MAE). \\n# Mean Absolute Error is simply equal to:\\n'"
